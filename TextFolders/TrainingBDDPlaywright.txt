JACOCO is used for the code coverage reports:
mvn clean verify surefire-report:report jacoco:report

Phase	   	What It Does
validate   	Validates the project structure
compile		Compiles the source code
test		Runs unit tests
package		Packages code into a .jar or .war
verify		Verifies test results, QA tools, coverage
install		Installs the .jar into the local repo
deploy		Deploys to a remote repository


Jenkins:
java -jar jenkins.war




MockMvc:


1. JUnit launches Spring test runner
2. @SpringBootTest starts full Spring context (controllers, services, repositories)
3. H2 in-memory DB is auto-configured
4. @Transactional ensures data is rolled back after test
5. mockMvc.perform(...) simulates a real HTTP request
6. Internally calls controller → service → repository (H2 DB)
7. Asserts response using mock JSON response
8. Test ends, DB resets


RestTemplate:


1. JUnit launches Spring test runner
2. SpringBootTest starts:
     - Spring context
     - Embedded Tomcat on random port (e.g., 65432)
3. H2 in-memory DB is auto-configured
4. (Optional) schema.sql/data.sql populates DB
5. restTemplate.exchange(...) sends a real HTTP request:
   → http://localhost:65432/addBook
6. Request flows through:
   → Embedded Tomcat (real HTTP layer)
   → Controller → Service → Repository → H2 DB
7. Controller returns response (converted to JSON)
8. restTemplate receives and maps JSON to Java object
9. Asserts status and body
10. Test ends, DB resets
